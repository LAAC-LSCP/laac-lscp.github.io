# Communication

## Language

Lab language is English (including scientific meetings).
Depending on who is involved, discussion may also be in French sometimes

## Meetings

Our meetings will typically be 30 mins long once a week.

We usualy do a goal review once a month.

Consider keeping record of all decisions relevant to some project in some central location (eg create channels in mattermost, or projects on github, etc)

## When you need someone

When somethings comes up.

- put it on the topics to discuss

- email, or drop by Alexâ€™ office (mezzanine above 406) or call

- for quick questions you can also use mattermost, which we check a lot more often than email
