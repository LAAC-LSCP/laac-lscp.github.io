# Communication

## Language

Lab language is English (including scientific meetings).
Depending on who is involved, discussion may also be in French sometimes

## Mattermost

We use [mattermost](https://mattermost.cognitive-ml.fr/laac/) as a way to discuss in the team on a daily bases. You will need to have an account and be added to the team channel.

## Meetings

We usually have a team meeting every week where we discuss various topics and where people can present their work.

Tipically a plenary meeting for the whole lab takes place once a month.

Other teams in the lab, like the CoML team for example, have their own meeting. You may want to attend some of them occasionaly.

The LSCP calendar is available [here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vsvnk7q30d9h9lj866g25m98ok%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FParis)
