## Getting in

Our lab (LSCP) is the only one on the 4th floor of the Jaurès building (29 rue d'ulm). Two ways of getting here:

1. You can come into the ENS through the 24 rue lhomond entrance; there is a buzzer on the right of the door, and a guard will buzz you right in. You can then follow the signs to the bâtiment Jaurès. Once inside Jaurès head up to the 4th floor. You'll see the stairs right away - in fact, you have to go up 5 steps to get to the ground level. If you'd rather not take the stairs up to the 4th floor, you'll find a very slow but effective elevator to the left after you've come up the 5 steps. If you're carrying something heavy or have mobility difficulties, prioritize the second option.

2. Alternatively, you can come in through 29 rue d'Ulm, but you need to wait for someone to open the door for you. You can wait and tell a passerby that you're meeting Dr. Cristia at the LSCP - they'll let you through. Or you can call me & I'll come down to meet you. When you make it in, go through the glass doors straight ahead. The elevator will be on your right, or you can take the stairs up to the 4th floor.

The lab is open from 9am to 7pm. You'll soon get a card (takes a couple of days for your name to pop up in the system).

- you need your card to re-enter the lab after going to the restroom

- codes to access the lab are kept [here](https://github.com/LAAC-LSCP/private-lab-info/blob/main/access_codes.md){:target="_blank"}

## Teleworking

teleworking 40% is allowed (but needs to be declared on a platform -- ask Radhia).

Most people are around on Tuesdays (Mondays, Thursdays).

If there are issues that would make it better for you to work from elsewhere you can totally do this! If it happens very frequently, let us know - perhaps there is something we can do to fix the situation.

## Lunch

- You can eat at the “cantine ENS”, located inside 45 rue d’Ulm (just follow the noon crowd!). Menus for outsiders are about 9E but quiches and sandwiches at the bar (at the end of the room) are 2-3E - you'll probably have an intermediate price. Ask about this when getting the ENS card.
- You can also get a sandwich etc from a nearby store (several on e.g. rue Saint Jacques, rue du pot de fer, rue mouffetard). 
- The kitchen is free for use, you can use the fridge & coffee machine but please read the instructions posted in the kitchen. Note you'll be expected to pitch in for cleaning if you do use the kitchen…
- There is also a coffee machine in the main hall downstairs, which is mug adaptable

## Equipement

- If you are missing computer hardware (cables, peripherals), you can ask Michel or Vireack.
- If you are missing pens, notebooks, etc - ask Radhia.

## Training opportunities

If you would like to get training on topics ranging from statistics, programming, to French as a foreign language, you can ask Radhia Achheb, who is 'correspondante formation'. Once you know when the course will take place & how long it lasts, ask Alex whether it would be appropriate for your project.

## Call rooms and how to book one

At the LSCP, video calls can be made in these three rooms : C401, C404 B and C412 B.
Each use must be the subject of a prior reservation to schedule via the Google calendars. If you do not have access to those, ask Philippe to send you the link to join them.
Use the calendar to create an event and associate it with the room's calendar.
NB : remember to put your name in the reservation. If you don't show up within 5 mins of your start time, someone else can take over the room.
