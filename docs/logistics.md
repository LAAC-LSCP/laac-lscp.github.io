# Administrative and logistic information

## Getting in

The lab is open from 9am to 7pm.

*--code of the lab door--*

*--code for the room key--*

## Teleworking

teleworking 40% is allowed (but needs to be declared on a platform -- ask Radhia)

## Lunch

- You can eat at the “cantine ENS”, located inside 45 rue d’Ulm (just follow the noon crowd!). Menus for outsiders are about 9E but quiches and sandwiches at the bar (at the end of the room) are 2-3E - you'll probably have an intermediate price. Ask about this when getting the ENS card 
- You can also get a sandwich etc from a nearby store (several on e.g. rue Saint Jacques, rue du pot de fer, rue mouffetard). 
- The kitchen is free for use, you can use the fridge & coffee machine but please read the instructions posted in the kitchen. Note you'll be expected to pitch in for cleaning if you do use the kitchen…
- There is also a coffee machine in the main hall downstairs, which is mug adaptable
