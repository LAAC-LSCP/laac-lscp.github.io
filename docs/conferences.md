## How to handle expenses for conference travel

The funding of conferences must imperatively be validated by Alex before any treatment. To this end, talk to Alex about it, as she needs to decide on which budget line (and therefore, which host institution -- see below) the expenses will be charge on and e-mail Philippe and Radhia about this, with you in cc. This should happen at least 6-8 weeks before the conference to allow all the processes mentioned below.

### If you are currently a LAAC member

1. Flight, train and hotel booking.
**Who** If you are a PhD student you can do it on your own. If you are a master student, Philippe will do it for you. 
**How** There is a transport and accommodation market, which depends on whether your travel will be paid by a budget line that is hosted by CNRS (ERC) or ENS (all others). 
- CNRS: To book both travel and accommodation, you have to register in [Goelett](https://accounts.goelett.com/login?signin=869d08e0ed98af3e978b4a87abab8108){:target="_blank"} to create an account with them. Then, log in, and do your search. When you have decided, click to book, and Radhia will be notified and she'll complete the booking and pay for it.
- ENS: ENS also uses the same market, but you have to access it using your ENS email address and [this link](https://grp-ens-psl-marche-cnrs-amue.hellofcm.com/profiles/sign_in){:target="_blank"}. The rest of the process is as for CNRS.


**Exception**: If you don't find the right travel options (e.g., you want to book a train or bus in a foreign country), or the right accommodation (e.g., none in the area), then you can pay for them directly and get reimbursed after the mission. You can also ask Philippe if he can get it bought for you, so that you don't have to disburse the money in advance.

2. Creation of the mission. 
If your salary is paid by CNRS, you can do this by yourself. Otherwise, then talk to Philippe, as you cannot do it on your own. 
Once you have booked your travel, you are ready for the next step. If you are a PhD student you can do it by your own. If you are a master student, Philippe will do it for you.
At least one month in advance, a mission must be created on the [Etamine website](https://e-missions.cnrs.fr/infos){:target="_blank"}.
N.B. The title of the mission matters! It should be entered starting with : "Projet EXELANG : conférence ..."

3. Book conference registration. 
Try to book as early as possible in order to benefit from "early bird" rates. To book the conference registration, you need to handle all of the procedure (create an account, fill in all forms, etc.) then give Radhia the link to the registration website, your username and password, so that Radhia can make the payment. If there is just a registration page, arrange with Radhia to fill in the whole registration page and come to see her so she can pay with the lab card.

4. Printing a poster.
If you need to printing a poster, at least a week before the conference, you should do the following:
A) Call avantage express (01 43 29 77 42) and ask them how much the poster will cost. We typically order an A0 matte.
B) Tell Radhia what the cost is, so that she creates a physical bon de commande that she will give you.
C) E-mail your poster (on pdf or ppt) to avantage express, tell them you're from ENS, and ask them to print your poster (in A0 matte).
D) Take the bon de commande to avantage express and pick up your poster. You can ask Alex for a poster tube to carry it to the conference.

5. Go to the conference! 
Now you are all set. Remember to keep receipts (these must be actual bills, and not just credit card receipts) for all meals. A maximum of two meals per day, of a certain amount (~15€), is allowed, and it's unclear that alcohol is covered. If in France, ask that they write "one meal", rather than itemizing. Also keep tickets for other reasonable expenses (buses, local trains, ...)

Things we don't know about yet:
- whether you are allowed to take taxis. It used to be that you can only take a taxi if arriving after midnight.
- whether you are allowed to book airbnb?


### If you are NOT currently a LAAC member

Book all travel, hotel, and register for the conference, keeping all receipts. After the conference is over, provide all receipts to get reimbursed. 

### After coming back from the conference

Scan or take photos of all receipts. Send them via email to Philippe (PhilippeDauli@gmail.com). Then bring the originals with you to the lab and give them to Philippe.
