## How to handle expenses for conference travel

The funding of conferences must imperatively be validated by Alex before any treatment. To this end, talk to Alex about it, as she needs to decide on which budget line (and therefore, which host institution -- see below) the expenses will be charged on and e-mail Radhia about this, with you in cc. This should happen at least 6-8 weeks before the conference to allow all the processes mentioned below.



### If you are currently a LAAC member

1. Creation of the mission. 
    **Who** If your salary is paid by CNRS, you can do this by yourself. Otherwise, talk to Radhia, as you cannot do it on your own. 
    **How** At least one month in advance, a mission must be created on the [Etamine website](https://etamine-connecte.cnrs.fr/infos){:target="_blank"}. You can only do the next step if you've done this one, and it has been approved. 
    >N.B. The title of the mission matters! It should be entered starting with « Projet ExELANG : conference name + dates ».
2. Flight, train and hotel booking.
    **Who** If you are a PhD student you can do it on your own. If you are a master student, Radhia will do it for you. 
    **How** There is a transport and accommodation market, which depends on whether your travel will be paid by a budget line that is hosted by CNRS (ERC) or ENS (all others). 
   - CNRS: To book both travel and accommodation, you have to register in [Goelett](https://accounts.goelett.com/login?signin=869d08e0ed98af3e978b4a87abab8108){:target="_blank"} to create an account with them. Then, log in, and do your search. When you have decided, click to book, and Radhia will be notified and she'll complete the booking and pay for it.
   - ENS: ENS also uses the same market, but you have to access it using your ENS email address and [this link](https://grp-ens-psl-marche-cnrs-amue.hellofcm.com/profiles/sign_in){:target="_blank"}. The rest of the process is as for CNRS.

    **Exception**: If you don't find the right travel options (e.g., you want to book a train or bus in a foreign country), or the right accommodation (e.g., none in the area), then you can pay for them directly and get reimbursed after the mission. You can also ask Radhia if he can get it bought for you, so that you don't have to disburse the money in advance.

3. Book conference registration. 
Try to book as early as possible in order to benefit from "early bird" rates. To book the conference registration, you need to handle all of the procedure (create an account, fill in all forms, etc.) then give Radhia the link to the registration website, your username and password, so that Radhia can make the payment. If there is just a registration page, arrange with Radhia to fill in the whole registration page and come to see her so she can pay with the lab card.

4. Printing a poster.
If you need to printing a poster, at least a week before the conference, you should do the following:
A) Call avantage express (01 43 29 77 42) and ask them how much the poster will cost. We typically order an A0 matte.
B) Tell Radhia what the cost is, so that she creates a physical bon de commande that she will give you.
C) E-mail your poster (on pdf or ppt) to avantage express, tell them you're from ENS, and ask them to print your poster (in A0 matte).
D) Take the bon de commande to avantage express and pick up your poster. You can ask Alex for a poster tube to carry it to the conference.

5. Go to the conference! 
Now you are all set. Remember to keep receipts (these must be actual bills, and not just credit card receipts) for all meals. A maximum of two meals per day, of a certain amount (~15€), is allowed, and it's unclear that alcohol is covered. If in France, ask that they write "one meal", rather than itemizing. Also keep tickets for other reasonable expenses (buses, local trains, ...)
Things we don't know about yet:
    - whether you are allowed to take taxis. It used to be that you can only take a taxi if arriving after midnight.
    - whether you are allowed to book airbnb?

6. Logistics

**[ETAMINE](https://etamine-connecte.cnrs.fr/infos) —** Creating a Mission (Declaring Occasion, Transportation & Accommodation).

> On the top-right of the home page, select « New Mission » to declare your event. Fill out all the necessary information (Title, Subject, Departure & Arrival times). You can always come back to this page to edit it later.
Please ensure that you « Validate » your mission (Green Saving Icon) then « Transmit » to Management.
Once Validated by the HR Department (this might take a up to a couple of days), you can now move onto the next website to manage your expenses. 
No rush!

_**After coming back from the conference**_

**[NOTILUS](https://esr-cnrs.notilus-inone.fr/#/Dashboard) —** Managing Expenses (Justifying Transactions & Requesting Reimbursement).

> On the top right of the page, select your Profile. Fill in your information in « My Data» with your personal details, including your phone number and address.

> Your mission, previously declared on ETAMINE, will now appear on your dashboard « Mission Orders ». Once you select it, pick the tab « Costs » and when a second row  « Costs » appears, select it too.

> If you’d like to insert additional refunds, choose an empty row.
Select the « + » button : fill in the purpose of the bill in « Remark », the total amount in « Sum » (in the corresponding currency indicated on the receipt) and add the necessary documents in «Attachement ». Submit your request by saving it.

> The red rows represent the missing information that needs to be filled out.
Select one but leave « Saisie » empty, it will however allow you to confirm your budget for the transaction you’re reclaiming.
Select « Attachement » and upload a scan or digital document of your receipt. Make sure to save when you’re done.

> Once your rows are full, find the column on the bottom right of the page and select the save icon before closing the page.

At this stage, Radhia takes over to validate your requests.

_Additional Information:_
* If you’d like to delete a row, simply select it and pick « Delete ».
* Every document should contain a single receipt.
* For a taxi trip, insert every way of your ride on a separate row.
* Include in the refunds: any subscription costs, other activities, etc.
* Excluded from the refunds: Coffee breaks, activities that are unrelated to the purpose of the trip, etc.

### If you are NOT currently a LAAC member

Book all travel, hotel, and register for the conference, keeping all receipts.

_**After coming back from the conference**_

Scan or take photos of all receipts. Send them via email to Radhia. Then bring the originals with you to the lab and give them to Radhia to get reimbursed.
