# For everyone

## Some paperwork

- [ ] Create an account in mattermost, the system we use for most communication. To do so click [here](https://mattermost.cognitive-ml.fr/signup_user_complete/?id=jmes7xi5obbmtnjw1bnn1o8tnh) and follow the instructions. When you're done creating the account, let Loann know and ask him to add you to the LAAC and LSCP teams.  Depending on your topic, you may also want to ask to be added to the CoML team.

- [ ] You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account to view the information that we keep private. Create an account if you don't have one and tell your handle to Loann.

- [ ] Get and sign the charte informatique from Michel Dutat.

- [ ] Get ENS card if you don't have one.

- [ ] If you are not getting any emails from the team, the lab, or the department ask Philippe -- we may have forgotten to put you in the relevant mailing lists.

## The lab environment

- [ ] Read [how communication is organized](./communication) in the lab.

- [ ] Check the [administrative and logistic information](./logistics).

- [ ] Read and complete the [ethics formation](./ethics).

- [ ] Meet people - you can find out their names, emails, & office number in 
[People in the LSCP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-e8knsDx-rcT-nSBc66jt5cV6788EMgOjDpw8wzcfe4/edit#gid=0).
