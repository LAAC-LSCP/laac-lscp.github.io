# For everyone

## Some paperwork

- [ ] Create an account in [mattermost](./communication.md#mattermost){:target="_blank"}, the system we use for most communication. To do so, ask Loann for an invite link, this will allow you to create an account and access the LAAC base channels.
- [ ] Send Philippe & Alex a message via mattermost with this information: Your name, email, start & end date, phone number
- [ ] Write a message in mattermost in the LAAC town square channel to introduce yourself to the team. Include your name, position, work subject and a funny/unusual/interesting fact about you.
- [ ] Download the [charte informatique](https://www.ssi.ens.fr/charte/charte.pdf), sign it electronically, and upload it [here](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/PjpzTjAhnNyOat3){:target="_blank"}.


## How do you get an ENS card?

- [ ] If you are a short-term intern or visitor (<1 month), you'll probably be assigned a visitor ENS card. Ask Philippe about it.
- [ ] If you are a longer term intern or visitor (>1 month), you need to fill in [this form](https://toucan.ens.fr/formulaire/){:target="_blank"} while connected through an ethernet cable from within ENS, fill it in, sign it, and email it to the address given in the form. For any doubts, ask Philippe about it. Then wait for an email informing you that your card is ready. In theory, this should take 3 days; but sometimes it's longer. Once you get the email: go to 45 rue d'Ulm, enter the main building, take the left and arrive at the card service (open Monday to Friday between 9:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 16:00). You will need to bring your identity card, then the ENS card will be produced to you immediately.
- [ ] If you are a long-term (PhD student, postdoc, engineer): 48 or 72 hours after signing your contract, you will have to go to 45 rue d'Ulm, enter the main building, take the left and arrive at the card service (open Monday to Friday between 9:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 16:00). You will need to bring your identity card, then the ENS card will be produced to you immediately.

## Troubleshooting

- [ ] If you are not getting any emails from the team, the lab, or the department ask Philippe -- we may have forgotten to put you in the relevant mailing lists. We normally do not add to mailing lists short-term interns. 
- [ ] We keep the codes for the copying machine/printer and keys private. You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} account to view the information that we keep private. Create an account if you don't have one and tell your handle to Loann via mattermost.


## The lab environment

- [ ] Read [how communication is organized](./communication) in the lab.
- [ ] Check the [administrative and logistic information](./logistics).
- [ ] Read and complete the [ethics formation](./ethics).
- [ ] Meet people - you can find out their names, emails, & office number in 
[People in the LSCP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-e8knsDx-rcT-nSBc66jt5cV6788EMgOjDpw8wzcfe4/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"}.
