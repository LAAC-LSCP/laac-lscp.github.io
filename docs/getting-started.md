# For everyone

## Some paperwork

- [ ] Create an account in [mattermost](./communication.md#mattermost){:target="_blank"}, the system we use for most communication. To do so, ask Loann for an invite link, this will allow you to create an account and access the LAAC base channels.
- [ ] You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} account to view the information that we keep private. Create an account if you don't have one and tell your handle to Loann via mattermost.
- [ ] Send Philippe & Alex a message via mattermost with this information: Your name, email, start & end date, phone number
- [ ] Write a message in mattermost in the LAAC town square channel to introduce yourself to the team. Include your name, position, work subject and a funny/unsual/interesting fact about you.
- [ ] Get and sign the charte informatique from Vireack.

You will need to bring your identity card, then the ENS card will be produced to you immediately.
