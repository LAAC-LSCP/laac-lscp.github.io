# Getting started as an intern

## Getting down to business

- [ ] Loann should ask Gwendal/Nick to add you on oberon and in the laac group. This will allow you to connect to the server and to the [ComL wiki](https://wiki.cognitive-ml.fr/).

- [ ] If you're not going to use your own, then get a team's computer   

- [ ] Sign up on [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/) and [OSF](https://osf.io) and give your handle to Loann.

- [ ] Set up your access to [oberon](../oberon) and learn the way it operates.

- [ ] Learn how to create and use [YODA repos](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html).

- [ ] Install [ChildProject](../childproject) and make sure you understand how to use it.
