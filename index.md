# Welcome to the LAAC team

## Mission statement

We work on early language acquisition. We are interested in how children come to learn their native language(s), what kinds of experiences they require to do this, and what kinds of biases and learning mechanisms they bring to the task. To this end, we use every tool available: lab experiments and computational modeling to check for specific learning mechanisms, analyses of day-long recordings and other corpora to describe input and outcomes, cohort analyses to study individual and group variation, meta-analyses to synthesize evidence, etc.

External validity is very important for us: We want to study language as it happens in the real world. This also entails studying language where it actually happens. Since most children are not growing up in Europe but in Africa & Asia, and more generally in low-income settings, we make it a goal to have their experiences and outcomes represented in the literature.
 
We make a commitment to doing science that is more likely to lead to real discoveries. We therefore follow a scientific procedure that takes this into account at all stages of our research projects:
Before we start, we typically use a systematic review or meta-analysis, to look at the evidence base. We ask ourselves whether there is evidence for selective reporting and other behaviors that may lead to misrepresentation of phenomena.
We pursue scientific goals by asking specific questions and clearly distinguishing between exploratory and confirmatory research. In the latter case, we put in place safeguards against false positives, by pre-registering our studies, and against false negatives, by appropriately powering our studies. One exception may occur when we wish to contribute to diversity in the representation of language acquisition participants, in which case we allow more flexibility in study design, analysis, and sample sizes, and adapt publication language appropriately.
When we decide to do a study, we also make a commitment to be transparent in terms of methods, analyses, and results. We typically have an OSF.io project and/or a github repository that will eventually become public; and our manuscripts are written using reproducible methods (such as RMarkdown). As much as possible, our data will be freely available. We ensure reproducibility of our work prior to final publication.
When a study is completed, we commit to making it public somehow through a journal or conference publication, or a pre-print or deposit otherwise.
 
Since we often collect and/or re-use data from populations that are under-represented in the literature, who are therefore minorities in this context, we make a commitment to make ethical treatment a top priority. This means we consider the needs and wishes of the population before, during, and after data collection and use, making sure, for example, that their privacy and identity are protected. We also think of the potential positive and negative impacts of this work throughout the process.
 
Since we study real language acquisition, we believe that our work is often (or perhaps always) relevant to society. We engage with society in a few ways:
when we do fieldwork, we make sure that the interaction is beneficial to the community that is collaborating with us
as a function of availability, we respond to requests for training by public agents (e.g., crèches, Cité des Sciences)
we participate in science outreach by producing press releases and selectively engaging with the press
we produce reports on aspects of the literature and our work that may be interesting to parents and other social agents
we provide advice to agents working on carefully-planned interventions
 
For the same reason, we commit to not provide advice:
to agents who do not have their participants' well-being as primary goal, or who are not using appropriate means (e.g., interventions that do not have a control group or a way to measure of potential positive and negative impact)
without having a good handle of the literature
that may increase inequality in educational opportunities
 
Another key aspect of our work is its interdisciplinary, collaborative nature. Many of our projects involve several members of the team; nearly all projects involve partners in other countries. We aim to promote communication across disciplinary and cultural boundaries, involving diverse partners. 

We believe that reflexive, open, ethical, collaborative, and interdisciplinary scientific practices are ideal for Early Career Researchers. We welcome students and young graduates from all disciplines, with any level of prior experience on language acquisition, and from any country, provided that they agree with us on our key goals and methods. We particularly encourage Early Career Researchers in our team to consider careers in and out of academia. We believe individuals with a solid scientific background are needed in all walks of life (industry, service, educational and health sectors, etc.).
